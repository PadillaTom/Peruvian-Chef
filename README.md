# Peruvian-Chef

## First HTML, CSS and Javascript Project.

Testing my capabilities in CSS, making a simple website.
Using Flexbox, Grid Layouts and a variety of Position.
Trying good use of Comments and to keep a "semantic" approach on HTML Elements.

Real case scenario: Working in a Peruvian Restaurant i got inspired to make a responsive website for one team member.
